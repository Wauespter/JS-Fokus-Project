# FokusProject

Project developed in the JavaScript course: manipulating the DOM! from Alura, in this course, I built the Fokus project, exploring different methods for manipulating elements in the DOM!
This project is inspired by the Pomodoro technique, which aims to focus on important tasks. This way, we focus on an activity for 25 minutes, for example, and after this period, it is possible to pause for 5 minutes or opt for a longer break of 15 minutes.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Functions in JavaScript
- JavaScript methods


### What I learned

- What is the DOM (Document Object Model) and how it represents the tree of nodes and objects;
- Manipulate elements in the DOM using JavaScript, specifically focusing on manipulating buttons;
- Use various selectors and methods, such as querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementsByClassName and getElementById, to select elements in the DOM;
- Differentiate DOM vs Document: We understand the differences between Document and DOM; Document is a global object that represents HTML, while DOM is a joint representation of several elements;
- Create variables for HTML elements: We learned how to create a variable to represent an HTML element in JavaScript;
- Change HTML texts with innerHTML, changing the HTML content structure with texts, tags and classes;
- Apply the switch method to switch contexts and change the display of texts according to the context;
- Activate and deactivate an audio file on the page with the help of the input Checkbox;
- Use audio properties and methods, 'play()' and 'pause()' to control audio playback on the page;
- Use the SetInterval method in the continuous execution of code snippets;
- Use ClearInterval to interrupt code execution;
- Concatenate strings and variables using the "+" operator to join strings and variables.
- Refactor the code: We identified repeated lines of code and refactored the code, creating the first function of the alterContexto project.
- Insert a timer on the screen by creating a specific function and using the innerHTML method to show the timer on the screen.
- Implement Date object in the Fokus project to format minutes and seconds of the page timer;
- Configure different timers for each of the three different page contexts: focus, short rest and long rest;
- I understood how to access and change elements in the DOM, a fundamental skill for creating dynamic interactions on web pages;
- I explored how to capture and respond to events such as clicks and form submissions, allowing our application to react to user actions;
- I learned how to maintain and update a local state for our application, using localStorage's ability to persist tasks and states between sessions;
- I learned a little about the art of dynamically creating elements in JavaScript and inserting them into the DOM, providing a real-time update to the user interface.
- I learned debugging and debugging techniques to make my daily life easier when I have behavior that is not desired. Therefore, I learned how to go step by step through my code and evolve the application


### Continuous development
Constantly overcoming challenges is what motivates me, with each step, with each challenge overcome I feel fulfilled, I continue in search of new horizons.

## Thanks
Firstly, I thank God for this opportunity to change careers, being able to use all my knowledge to develop tools that can be used to help many people and companies.
I would also like to thank my wife and partner, who motivates me to follow my dreams and keeps me focused on my goals.
